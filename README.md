Credit Card Fraud Analysis - SQL & Tableau
Project Overview

This project analyzes credit card transactions to identify patterns associated with fraudulent activity. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions recorded over a two-day period, including 492 confirmed frauds. Due to the extremely low fraud rate (0.172%), the challenge requires careful analysis and meaningful visualizations to highlight hidden fraud patterns.

The project includes data cleaning, SQL-based exploration, summary table creation, and an interactive Tableau dashboard for insight communication.

Objectives

Analyze hourly fraud behavior.

Compare fraud distribution across time periods (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).

Understand fraud trends across different transaction amount ranges.

Build SQL summary tables to support Tableau visualizations.
